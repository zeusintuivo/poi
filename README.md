A set of tools to contribute to Mozilla better. 

Why ?
=======
Because there you are, trying to make a difference to the world. And you turn your eye into "mozilla." The fascinating world of coding for Mozilla. After a week hours in the machine, you realize: "geeez this is harder than I thought, I might as well go back to been selfish and not move a single finger." 

It turns out, learning to contribute is very hard. The instructions are very complex, and usages and commiting and pushing. It only gets you huffing and puffing.

After detailed analysis, I thought to make a significant contribution by creating effitient way to contribute, with less headches. 


Tools 
======

kuma-* A set of scripts for Mozilla Developer Network (Kuma) MDN to facilitate the contributing workflow with ease. Based on the instructions from Kuma's https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and Install http://kuma.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation-vagrant.html.

fireplace-* A set of scripts for Mozilla Marketplace (fireplace) to facilitate the contributing workflow with ease. Based on the instructions from Kuma's https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and Install http://kuma.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation-vagrant.html.

About Naming
=====
I named them "kuma", or "fireplace", because it will make it easier to remember in which folder I am working for example

> kuma is for

~~~
~/Sites/kuma (master) $ _
~~~



Install 
======
I recommend to git clone it or append it to ~/bin like this:

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/zeusintuivo/poi ~/bin
~~~~

If you already have stuff in ~/bin
then you can just add it like this:

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/zeusintuivo/poi ~/bin2
cp -rf ~/bin2/* /bin
~~~~

This will leave ~/bin2 directory folder in your ~/
if you want you want to delete it:

~~~~
rm -rf ~/bin2
~~~~

Stage
=====
20141010 - Creation. This is my first try. I guess you can call it *alpha for now
